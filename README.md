# Fabric Classification, Retrieval, and Generation

## Overview

In this project, we conducted comprehensive tasks involving fabric design classification, object detection, and generative AI. The key components of the project are as follows:

- **Fabric Design Classification:** Utilizing the LightGBM algorithm to accurately classify different fabric designs.
- **Object Detection:** Employing the YOLOv8 model to detect objects of interest within fabric images.
- **Generative AI:** Leveraging the stable diffusion model (Dreambooth) to generate new fabric designs based on learned patterns and styles.

This multifaceted approach allows us to classify existing fabric designs, detect objects within fabric images, and explore creative possibilities by generating novel fabric designs using generative AI techniques.
